Xbox360 Xex Loader v6.6 for IDA v6.4 - xorloser




:: Overview

These loaders will let you load an xex file directly into IDA without
havig to do any preprocessing first. The accompanying Xbox360.xml file
contains lists of imports that are used to name functions imported
into the xex being disassmebled.

While this was built with the IDA SDK v6.4, it may well still work
fine with earlier versions of IDA. I haven't tested this however.




:: Install

To install these loaders you need to copy all files in this package
int your "IDA\loaders" directory. You will probably have to restart
IDA after doing so if it is currently open.
